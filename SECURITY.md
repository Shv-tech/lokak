# Reporting Security Issues

The lokaksema team and community take security bugs in the website seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory tab.

The lokaksema team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.


## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within 6 business days, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the founder of SHV Groups - Shaurya Verma.

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within 14 days, escalation is also appropriate.
